        <h4>Deep Dive</h4>
        <p>Outside of my academic coursework, I have also taken steps to prepare for a career in the software engineering industry by working as a coding instructor for local kids and joining STEM groups. As a <span class="highlighted-phrase">coding instructor</span> for both <span class="highlighted-phrase">CodeWithUs</span> and <span class="highlighted-phrase">Connected Camps</span>, I had the opportunity to develop an introductory curriculum to coding fundaments and break down concepts into digestible, interactive tutorials. These roles required <span class="highlighted-phrase">leadership</span>/<span class="highlighted-phrase">conflict resolution</span> to manage a classroom of 3rd-8th graders. </p>
        <p>While at CSU - Stanislaus, I also had the opportunity to be a part of the <span class="highlighted-phrase">Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions</span> (CAHSI), <span class="highlighted-phrase">CSU STEM Pathways and Research Alliance</span> (CSU-SPaRA), and <span class="highlighted-phrase">Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation</span> (LSAMP). These three organizations provided <span class="highlighted-phrase">mentorship</span>, <span class="highlighted-phrase">networking events</span>, and <span class="highlighted-phrase">career preparedness</span> through activities like workshops and guest lectures in order to provide opportunities and connect students from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
        <p>During my undergraduate research experience with CAHSI, I was able to present my research in the <span class="highlighted-phrase">Research Poster Competition</span> at the <span class="highlighted-phrase">Great Minds in STEM</span> (GMiS) Conference. At the conference I was also able to attend several <span class="highlighted-phrase">workshops</span> led by senior engineers and learn about relevant technologies/concepts such as <span class="highlighted-phrase">deep learning</span>, <span class="highlighted-phrase">cybersecurity</span>,and <span class="highlighted-phrase">supercomputing</span></p>
