        <p>Although I started my higher education as a Business Major, I quickly found a passion in coding and joined a 
            <span class="highlighted-phrase">Software Engineering Immersive</span> experience, <span class="highlighted-phrase">Hack Reactor</span>, and learned Full-Stack Web Development with React and Express using SQL and noSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. After completing the program, I returned to college to pursue an <span class="highlighted-phrase">A.S in Computer Science</span> from <span class="highlighted-phrase">San Joaquin Delta College</span> where I learned coding/CS fundamentals. I followed up my Associates Degree with a <span class="highlighted-phrase">B.S. Computer Science</span> from <span class="highlighted-phrase">CSU - Stanislaus</span> which I recently received in Fall of 2025. Here I got to dive deeper into advanced Computer Science concepts where I was able to study topics ranging from the Theory of Algorithms to Android Development to Neural Networks.</p>
        <p>Throughout my education I have also had the opportunity to be a part of the <span class="highlighted-phrase">Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions</span> (CAHSI), <span class="highlighted-phrase">CSU STEM Pathways and Research Alliance</span> (CSU-SPaRA), and <span class="highlighted-phrase">Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation</span> (LSAMP). These three organizations provided mentorship, networking events, and career preparedness through activities like workshops and guest lectures in order to provide opportunities and connect students from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
