        <h4>Deep Dive</h4>
        <p>Although I started my higher education as a Business Major, I quickly found a passion in coding and joined a <span class="highlighted-phrase">Software Engineering Immersive</span> experience, <span class="highlighted-phrase">Hack Reactor</span>, and learned Full-Stack Web Development with React and Express using SQL and noSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. After completing the program, I returned to college to pursue an <span class="highlighted-phrase">A.S in Computer Science</span> from <span class="highlighted-phrase">San Joaquin Delta College</span> where I learned coding/CS fundamentals. I followed up my Associates Degree with a <span class="highlighted-phrase">B.S. Computer Science</span> from <span class="highlighted-phrase">CSU - Stanislaus</span> which I recently received in Fall of 2025. Here I got to dive deeper into advanced Computer Science concepts where I was able to study topics ranging from the <span class="highlighted-phrase">Theory of Algorithms</span> to <span class="highlighted-phrase">Android Development</span> to <span class="highlighted-phrase">Neural Networks.</span></p>
